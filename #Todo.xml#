Fixed the immediate example, but now CreateSession doesn't work in wsGoBioBase.
The short nodes don't get a value. .literal is true.
<br/>
Problem with whether to create a text node for a toSOAP(vector, XMLInternalElement, BasicSOAPType)
or to just return the value.
Issue is exemplified in the ndfdXMLserver.php.wsdl and MassSpecAPI.wsdl interfaces.
The former uses a type in the &lt;art&gt;. The latter uses an element for the mass, etc.
So we either create the node for the former and pass that as the parent,
or we can add an argument to toSOAP.
Check  writeSOAPBody(con = "XMLInternalDocument"),
SearchByMass2 is literal = TRUE.
NDFDgenByDay is literal = FALSE.
That's the difference! Implemented now for vector.

Problems now with iType in w@types[[2]]$iType. 
This is genuine recursion as iType has a choice with
bType, uType and smallcapsType but
smallcapsType  has a bType, uType and a iType.
So there is cross-referencing of types.
We need a different strategy to deal with this.
One approach is that we only need their names and do not necessarily need to resolve
the elements. 
Another approach is that we eagerly resolve XML nodes when reading the
schema and so avoid references. This is not necessarily possible to implement completely. 
We can detect such recursion by passing a collection of pending names.
Technically, we want the namespace and name. Or we could pass a list of objects
and see if any is in there. A named character vector of name and uri as the name.
What do we do when we detect this? What does resolve return - a pending object?
<br/>
setClass doesn't need the classes for the slots to be defined. It is only setClassUnion.
(Why is I believe an implementation detail.) 
So if we can work around this, we can solve the problem.
So defClass for UnionDefinition could avoid resolving the slots
completely, but just get their names.

<br/>
Below is FIXED<br/>
recursive problems in ops.wsdl with rangeType.
But there is no nsuri. It is character(). There is one in ops.xsd at the top-level of the 
schema.
This is handled in processSchemaType in the 
<r:code><![CDATA[
if(xmlName(type) == 'complexType' && all(names(type) %in% c("attribute", "attributeGroup")))
]]></r:code>
clause at line 402 (now).
<br/>
I have turned off the processing of this type and we still end up with a SOAPComplexType
but with the correct nsuri. So this is good. But this should be a ClassDefinition
with two slots.
Now being processed at line 528. Here we explicitly create a SOAPComplexType.
Should be a ClassDefinition.
<br/>
What WSDL and type was the original clause implemented for?
<br/>
What if we remove the SOAPComplexType methods for resolve? Still problem
but not the same warnings!!!!

Now problem in ops.wsdl with

This is defining any-referenceType. 
Looks like we are getting the names from the Elements, but not from their types.
This is in mapSOAPTypeToS.

<item status="done">
For ops.wsdl, now get a "  attempt to use zero-length variable name"
error in getClassDef().  Trying to define priority-claimType,
and that induces its base class definition and that involves a Union
office-of-filingType.  
The repn for this has a "" in the first element.
The first element of slotTypes has "" as its name. It is a ClassDefinition.
The XML is 
<pre><![CDATA[
	<complexType name = "office-of-filingType">
		<choice>
			<sequence>
				<element name = "region" type = "exch:regionType"/>
				<element name = "country" type = "exch:countryType" minOccurs = "0"/>
			</sequence>
			<element name = "country" type = "exch:countryType"/>

Changes now cause MassSpecAPI wsdl to infinitely recurse
when resolving StringArray.
<br/>
The problem is that we have two ArrayOfString elements in w@types[[1]].
Now they are both Element objects. In the older versions (0.4-0) of XMLSchema,
these were SimpleSequenceType and Element. So the first one has become an element.
There is no reason for this:
<pre><![CDATA[

     <s:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" name="string" nillable="true" type="s:string" />

That extends the one in exchange with the same name.

in createClassRepresentation and above that in defineClassDefinition.
This happens when we resolve the baseType in defineClassDefinition for the

Turns out, priority-active-indicator in w@types[[2]][["priority-active-indicator"]] is
<r:null/>.
This is an element and then a simpleType with a restriction.
Problem was processSchemaElement was not handling that case and returning NULL explicitly.

4th slot in priority-claimType, i.e. priority-linkage-type.

<r:code>
XMLSchema:::resolve(w@types[[2]]$"priority-claimType"@slotTypes[[4]], w@types)

This goes through SOAPTypeReference first and then tries to resolve the type.

Explicitly determine slot if type is NULL. But is this an inherited slot

Perhaps when we resolve the type to put in the parameters or in the return value slot, 
we have to collect all the inherited slots.  This can just merge the slot types.

with xmlNamespaceDefinitions(doc) and perhaps store it in the SOAPServerDescription
and then pass it to genSOAPClientInterface() from that. 
But why did we not need it in the past?  We must have resolved everything.
<br/>
"http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/soap/brenda.wsdl"      
The types we end up with here is a SchemaTypes, not a SchemaCollection.
Use to be fine. So something has changed.
The namespaceDefs() we pass along to resolve is an empty list and is so in
defineClasses.

DbListType.
This is a locally defined element, so we have to resolve it when

We need to add an argument to tell processSchemaType that element
nodes need to be "resolved" now.

[Fixed] Now we are having issues with a class definition - IconUrlType -
trying to define dependent/referenced classes that are enumerations!
The class has an AttributeDef whose type slot is an EnumValuesDef.
So we should just be mapping this to the R type 
corresponding to the name of the Enum type. If there is no name,
let's make one up from the name of the outer class and the slot name (LNG).
At present, the name is coming from combining the enum names.
<br/>
The class IconUrlType should be an Extension class 
<br/>
This IdUrlSetType object also has a slot that is a choice of two elements
so we need an intermediate ClassUnion for this.
<br/>
SpelledQuery is similar.  Also getting the wrong type here.
It should be a sequence of 0 or more entries of the UnionDefinition, not just a single
instance.
(We could use the names of the element for the names of the elements.
These are also both strings so we could use a character rather than a list here.)
We also don't need to define a class here but just map the element straight to the
type - a character.

The following is fixed in fixTypeNames.
<br/>
In EPO, application-referenceType is in http://www.epo.org/exchange and http://ops.eop.org
target namespaces and the latter extends the former.  So we need the names to be different.
We also need to ensure the base class is defined
<br/>

there are two LinkType complexType nodes and we

The genSOAPClientInterface step fails because of "references-citedType"
and the second element of the choice in that complexType defn. doesn't have a
name. It is an anonymous class. So we can inline the defn or define it separately
and then refer to it.

Converter for Sequence may need to create the class definition
if it doesn't appear in the schema.
e.g. in the operation listMethods, the return type is a sequence:
<r:code>
trace(SSOAP:::processWSDLOperation, quote(if(xmlGetAttr(node, "name") == "listMethods") browser()))
w = processWSDL("http://www.fedora.info/definitions/api/Fedora-API-A-LITE.wsdl")
f = genSOAPClientInterface(,w)
</r:code>
The problem seems to be that the listMethodsResponse element is
complexType/sequence with a type attribute and so we could infer is an R list of ObjectMethodsDef.
But the listMethodsResponse message element has 
<programlisting><![CDATA[
  <message name="listMethodsResponse">
    <part name="response" type="fedora-types:ArrayOfObjectMethodsDef">
      <documentation>A set of method definitions that represent 
				all possible disseminations that can be run on the object.
			</documentation>
    </part>
  </message>
]]></programlisting>
Note the fedora-types prefix on the value of the type attribute.
<programlisting><![CDATA[
    <operation name="listMethods">
      <input message="fedora-api:listMethodsRequest"/>
      <output message="fedora-api:listMethodsResponse"/>
    </operation>
]]></programlisting>

In resolve for SOAPType, if we fail to find a definition,
we can look at the name of the type and see if it starts
with ArrayOf. If so, we can create an ArrayType
